## First Officially Supported Release 2.x üì£
We now have a fully working and official release 2.x of Slickgrid-React and a new [Live Demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-react-demos/) which is being used by Cypress E2E tests.

### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) which was originally developed by @mleibman is now available to React. SlickGrid beats most other datagrids in terms of functionalities and performance (it can easily deal with even a million row). Slickgrid-React is a wrapper on top of SlickGrid and we are using the [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/) fork which is the most active fork since the original was put on pause by its original author for personal reasons. Also worth to know, that I also contributed a lot to the 6pac/SlickGrid fork for the benefit of all the SlickGrid libraries that I maintain like this one here....

## Installation
Refer to the **[Wiki - HOWTO Step by Step](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/wiki/HOWTO--Step-by-Step)** and/or clone the [Slickgrid-React-Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react-demos) repository. Please consult all Wikis before opening new issues, also consider asking installation and/or general questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=slickgrid) unless you think there's a bug with the library.

## Wiki / Documentation
The Wiki is where all the documentation and instructions will go, so please consult the [slickgrid-react - Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/wiki) before opening any issues. The [Wiki - HOWTO](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/wiki/HOWTO---Step-by-Step) is a great place to start with. You can also take a look at the [Demo page](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-react), it includes sample for most of the features and it keeps growing (so you might want to consult it whenever a new version comes out).

## Main features
You can see some screenshots below and the instructions down below and if that is not enough for you to decide, head over to the [Wiki - Main Features](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/wiki).

## Missing features
What if `Slickgrid-React` is missing feature(s) compare to the original core library [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/)?

Fear not, and just simply reference the `SlickGrid` and `DataView` objects, just like in the core lib, those are exposed through Event Emitters. For more info continue reading on [Wiki - SlickGrid & DataView objects](/slickgrid-universal/slickgrid-react/wiki/SlickGrid-&-DataView-Objects) and [Wiki - Grid & DataView Events](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/wiki/Grid-&-DataView-Events)


## Screenshots

Screenshots from the demo app with the `Bootstrap` theme.

_Note that the styling changed a bit, the best is to simply head over to the [Live Demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-react) page._
