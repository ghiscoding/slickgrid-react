### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to the React world. SlickGrid beats most other datagrids in terms of features, customizability & performance (running smoothly with even a million rows). Slickgrid-React is a wrapper on top of [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) (which is required), in the early beginning we used the `6pac/SlickGrid` fork but that was dropped in >=[v4.0](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/releases/tag/v4.0.2) since Slickgrid-Universal is now a standalone project. SlickGrid was also recently rewritten with browser native code (no more ~jQuery~ 🎉).
